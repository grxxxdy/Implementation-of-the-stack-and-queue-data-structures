# Task 1:
The web page data structure has the following fields: URL address, page size in KB, and whether it has a secure connection. Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a history stack of visited pages with a history size of 5.  
2. Visit 4 different pages and record them in the history.  
3. Take the last visited page, enable a secure connection on it, and record it again in the stack.  
4. Record 3 more pages in the history.  
5. Remove the last page from the history.  
6. Remove 5 more pages from the history.

# Task 2:
The product data structure has the following fields: name, price, expiration period (days). Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a queue of products at the store checkout, with a queue size of 5.  
2. Place 4 different products on it.  
3. Take the first product, apply a 25% discount coupon to it, and return it to the queue.  
4. Add 3 more products.  
5. Remove 3 products from the queue.  
6. Remove 4 more products from the queue.
# Task 3:
Solve the "Bracket Sequence" problem:

Implement an algorithm based on the stack written in the previous tasks, which checks whether a sequence of different types of opening and closing brackets is correct.
